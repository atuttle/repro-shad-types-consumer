<script lang="ts">
	import { Button } from 'repro-shad-types';
</script>

<Button>test button</Button>

<p>
	If you edit the code for the button above, add a space between <code>&lt;Button</code> and
	<code>&gt;</code> and maybe even hit ctrl+space to trigger auto-complete, you'll see that the known
	props for the button are not suggested.
